# Key Economic Insights: Kenya (2000-2023)

## Executive Summary
Analysis of 23 years of World Bank economic data reveals Kenya's transformation from a $14B to $113B economy, marked by steady growth punctuated by external shocks.

## Insight #1: Consistent GDP Expansion Despite Shocks
**Finding**: Kenya's GDP grew 8-fold from 2000-2023, averaging 4.7% annual growth.

**Evidence**:
- GDP (current USD): $14B (2000) → $113B (2023)
- Average GDP growth rate: 4.7% annually
- Only 1 year of negative growth (2020: -0.3% due to COVID-19)

**Significance**: Demonstrates economic resilience and diversification beyond agriculture.

## Insight #2: Persistent Trade Deficit
**Finding**: Kenya has run a trade deficit every year since 2000, averaging -12% of GDP.

**Evidence**:
- Trade balance: Negative in all 23 years
- Average deficit: -12.3% of GDP
- Imports consistently exceed exports by 10-15 percentage points

**Significance**: Indicates structural import dependence (fuel, machinery). Opportunity for import substitution.

## Insight #3: Inflation Volatility with Stabilization Post-2012
**Finding**: Inflation averaged 7.2% but was highly volatile (2008-2012), stabilizing to <6% post-2015.

**Evidence**:
- 2000-2007: Moderate (6-8%)
- 2008-2011: Volatile (9-18%)
- 2012-2023: Stable (4-6%)

**Significance**: Reflects improved Central Bank policy and currency stability.

## Insight #4: Rising Debt-to-GDP Ratio
**Finding**: External debt grew faster than GDP, raising sustainability concerns.

**Evidence**:
- Debt-to-GDP ratio: 38% (2000) → 67% (2023)
- Fastest growth: 2013-2023 (infrastructure boom)

**Significance**: Requires fiscal discipline to avoid debt distress.

## Insight #5: Unemployment Data Gaps Limit Analysis
**Finding**: World Bank unemployment data for Kenya is sparse (50% missing years).

**Evidence**:
- Missing data: 2000-2010, 2019-2023
- Available years show 9-12% unemployment

**Significance**: Highlights need for improved labor statistics collection.

## Recommendations for Dashboard
1. Emphasize GDP growth story (strong narrative)
2. Visualize trade deficit consistently (persistent issue)
3. Show inflation stabilization (policy success)
4. Flag debt concerns (forward-looking risk)
5. Note data limitations (analytical honesty)
